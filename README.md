<h1>🧠 ML Project: Insurance Premium Prediction.</h1>

A machine learning project that predicts health insurance premiums using user features such as age, BMI, smoker status, etc.
Based on Codebasics ML course workflows

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/gautamprafful007/ML-project-premium-prediction.git
cd ML-project-premium-prediction

2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt


🧪 Overview of the Workflow

1. Data Loading & Exploration
Load the dataset (e.g., insurance.csv) containing features: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, and target charges.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA):
Check null values and duplicates
Plot distributions (pie charts, box plots, scatter plots) to understand feature-target relationships (e.g., smokers vs premium) 

2. Preprocessing
Encode categorical variables: sex, smoker, region as numeric labels.
Detect and handle outliers (e.g., in BMI using IQR and capping) 
Scale and normalize numerical features if necessary.

3. Feature Engineering
Correlation analysis to identify features most impacting the charges.
Final selection of relevant input features (e.g., age, sex, BMI, smoker) 

4. Model Development & Evaluation
Split data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20).
Train multiple ML models:
Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, Gradient Boosting.
Compare performance using metrics like RMSE and R².
Select the best-performing model (often Random Forest or XGBoost) 

5. Prediction Helper (prediction_helper.py)
Contains functions:
preprocess_input(): encodes and scales new user input.
predict_premium(): loads the trained model and outputs premium prediction.
Optional risk scoring or auxiliary processing logic.

6. Main Script (main.py)
Integrates data flow:
Load model and helper.
Accept input values (e.g., via CLI or a simple UI).
Use helper functions to preprocess and predict.
Display output premium estimate.

🛠️ Run & Test the Script

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
You can supply a test input dictionary like:

python
Copy
Edit
{
  "age": 30,
  "sex": "male",
  "bmi": 28.0,
  "children": 1,
  "smoker": "no",
  "region": "northeast"
}
It will preprocess and return the predicted premium amount.

📊 Results & Insights

Visualizations help understand how features like smoking status or BMI impact insurance cost.
Correlation analysis confirms strong association particularly of smoker with charges (~0.78 correlation) 
Model evaluations typically show Random Forest or XGBoost outperform others in RMSE and R² metrics.

🔋 Future Enhancements

Expand feature space: include more inputs (e.g., medical history, insurance type).
Use more advanced preprocessing (e.g., missing value imputation, polynomial features).
Convert into a web app (Flask/Streamlit) and deploy (e.g. Heroku) for real-time interactivity.
Provide confidence intervals or future cost trends based on user’s health change trajectory.
